Revision history for Net-NSCA-Client
====================================

0.009001 2011-05-05
  * FIX: The test `t/live_server.t` had a test at the beginning to
    test for the exception of connecting to nothing. Since these error
    messages are not the same always, the test is changed to just
    test for any exception.

0.009 2011-05-02
  * FIX: An attribute was missing the lazy attribute and Moose 2.00
    caused this to make the tests failed. Added the lazy attribute.
  * FIX: When the `initialization_vector_length` is changed in ServerConfig
    the new value is honored.
  * A specific error message will occur if the remote server disconnects
    early.
  * Add a troubleshooting guide.
  * Change all uses of `Readonly` to `Const::Fast`.
  * Change all uses of `Test::Exception` to `Test::Fatal`.
  * Lots of new tests; very close to 100% coverage.

0.008 Mon, August 30, 2010 22:11:22 -0400
  * FIX: Actually sending a report was broken with a message about
    not being able to clone something.

0.007 Tue, August 24, 2010 10:18:12 -0400
  * NEW: This module can now communicate with NSCA servers that have
    been custom-compiled with different packet constants.
  * Check for data integrety when decoding packets.
  * Fill empty space in packets with random alpha numeric data as the
    standard NSCA client/server does.
  * Change distribution management from `Module::Install` to
    `Module::Build`.
  * FIX: Remove test that failed when the data "didn't look random".

0.006 Tue, November 3, 2009 10:56:45 -0500
  * THIS CONTAINS AN IMPORTANT FIX AND PREVIOUS VERSIONS ARE NOT
    RECOMMENDED.
  * Fixed an issue where the client would try to parse the initial
    packet too early and throw an error about the UNIX timestamp
    not meeting a type constraint.

0.005 Sun, November 1, 2009 01:35:12 -0500
  * Finally fixed the test failures for t/send_nsca.t by requiring
    Pod::Usage 1.36+ for the script.

0.004 Sat, October 31, 2009 20:50:12 -0400
  * Modified t/send_nsca.t test so that the non-present required modules
    for the utility will not cause the entire module to fail.

0.003 Sat, October 31, 2009 16:40:01 -0400
  * New bin/send_nsca utility. This is an emulation of the send_nsca
    utility that comes with the NSCA package.
  * Changed from using Crypt::Random to Data::Rand::Obscure for generation
    of random IV when creating a Net::NSCA::Client::InitialPacket (note:
    this package itself never uses this feature).
  * No longer use Test::Most in tests, as it was unnecessary.

0.002 Thu, October 8, 2009 17:35:10 -0400
  * FIX: All Moose classes are now immutable
  * FIX: Creating a Net::NSCA::Client::InitialPacket without an IV would
    cause an error since the default ended up being a Math::Pari object
    [NOTE: This only would have affected code which explicitly created
     a Net::NSCA::Client::InitialPacket object]
  * Added a public constant $INITIALIZATION_VECTOR_LENGTH to
    Net::NSCA::Client::InitialPacket
  * initialization_vector attribute in Net::NSCA::Client::InitialPacket
    is now always exactly 128 bytes.
  * Fixed documentation in Net::NSCA::Client::DataPacket to specify all
    required attributes.
  * Added SEE ALSO section in Net::NSCA::Client
  * Added tests for many pieces of the objects and for packet reading
    and creation.

0.001 Tue, October 1, 2009 20:35:12 -0400
  * First release.
  * NOTE: There are currently no tests besides a load test, so there
    is no real way to know if it is working on your system when installing.
