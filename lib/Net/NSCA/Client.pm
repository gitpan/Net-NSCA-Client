=head1 NAME

Net::NSCA::Client - Send passive checks to Nagios locally and remotely.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::NSCA::Client;

  my $nsca = Net::NSCA::Client->new(
    remote_host => 'nagios.example.net',
  );

  $nsca->send_report(
    hostname => 'web1.example.net',
    service  => 'MYSQL',
    message  => $plugin_output,
    status   => $Net::NSCA::Client::STATUS_OK,
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Send passive checks to Nagios locally and remotely.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This is fully object-oriented, and as such before any method can be used, the
constructor needs to be called to create an object to work with.

=head2 new

This will construct a new object.

=over

=item new(%attributes)

C<%attributes> is a HASH where the keys are attributes (specified in the
L</ATTRIBUTES> section).

=item new($attributes)

C<$attributes> is a HASHREF where the keys are attributes (specified in the
L</ATTRIBUTES> section).

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

  # Set an attribute
  $object->attribute_name($new_value);

  # Get an attribute
  my $value = $object->attribute_name;

=head2 encryption_password

This is the password to use with the encryption.

=head2 encryption_type

This is a string of the encryption type. See
L<Net::NSCA::Client::Connection::TLS|Net::NSCA::Client::Connection::TLS>
for the different encryption types.

=head2 remote_host

This is the remote host to connect to. This will default to L</$DEFAULT_HOST>.

=head2 remote_port

This is the remote port to connect to. This will default to L</$DEFAULT_PORT>.

=head2 server_config

This specifies the configuration of the remote NSCA server. See
L<Net::NSCA::Client::ServerConfig|Net::NSCA::Client::ServerConfig> for details
about using this. Typically this does not need to be specified unless the
NSCA server was compiled with customizations.

=head2 timeout

This is the timeout to use when connecting to the service. This will default to
L</$DEFAULT_TIMEOUT>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 clear_encryption_password

This will remove the encryption password that is currently set.

=head2 hsa_encryption_password

This will return a Boolean if there is any encryption password.

=head2 send_report

This will send a report on a service to the remote NSCA server. This method
takes a HASH of arguments with the following keys:

=head3 hostname

This is the hostname of the service that is being reported.

=head3 service

This is the service description of the service that is being reported.

=head3 message

This is the message that the plug in gives to Nagios.

=head3 status

This is the status code to report to Nagios. You will want to use one of the
C<$STATUS_*> constants.

=head1 SPECIFICATION

=head2 NSCA PROTOCOL 3

The NSCA protocol is currently at version 3. Simply put, the NSCA protocol is
very simple from the perspective for the C language. The NSCA program has a
C structure that is populated and then sent across the network in raw form.
Below is the definition of the C structure taken from C<common.h> in NSCA
version 2.7.2.

  struct data_packet_struct {
    int16_t   packet_version;
    u_int32_t crc32_value;
    u_int32_t timestamp;
    int16_t   return_code;
    char      host_name[MAX_HOSTNAME_LENGTH];
    char      svc_description[MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH];
    char      plugin_output[MAX_PLUGINOUTPUT_LENGTH];
  };

When the client connects to the server, the server sends a packet with the
following C structure taken from C<common.h> in NSCA version 2.7.2.

  struct init_packet_struct {
    char      iv[TRANSMITTED_IV_SIZE];
    u_int32_t timestamp;
  };

The packet is first completely zeroed, and thus made empty. Next, the packet
is filled randomly with alpha-numeric characters. The C library actually fills
it randomly with ASCII characters between C<0x30> and C<0x7A>. All values are
now filled into the structure (only overwriting what needs to be written,
keeping randomness intact). The C<timestamp> value is set to the same value
that was sent by the server in the initial response and C<crc32_value> is set
to all zeros. The CRC32 is calculated for this packet and stored in the packet.
Next, the packet in encrypted with the specified method (which MUST be exactly
as set in the server) and sent across the network.

=head3 Encryption

=head4 None

When there is no encryption, then the packet is completely unchanged.

=head4 XOR

This is the obfucated method and so is no encryption. This is merely to attempt
to mask the data to make it harder to see. The packet is first XOR'd with the
IV that was sent by the server, one byte at a time. Once all bytes from the IV
have been used, then it starts again from the first byte of the IV. After this,
the packet is then XOR'd with the provided password and the same steps as
followed by the IV are followed for the password (byte-per-byte, looping).

=head4 All other Encryptions

All other specified encryption methods are performed in cipher feedback (CFB)
mode, at one byte.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=head2 C<$DEFAULT_HOST>

The is the default host to use when connecting.

=head2 C<$DEFAULT_PORT>

This is the default port number to use when connecting to a remote host.

=head2 C<$DEFAULT_TIMEOUT>

This is the default timeout to use when connecting to a remote host.

=head2 C<$STATUS_OK>

This is the status value when a service is OK

=head2 C<$STATUS_WARNING>

This is the status value when a service is WARNING

=head2 C<$STATUS_CRITICAL>

This is the status value when a service is CRITICAL

=head2 C<$STATUS_UNKNOWN>

This is the status value when a service is UNKNOWN
